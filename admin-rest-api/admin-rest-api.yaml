  APIKeyAuth:
    type: apiKey
    in: header
    name: X-Auth-Token
    description: >
      A valid API key is required to access this API.  API keys can be allocated
      via the IBM Cloud interface, and are associated with an instance of the
      Event Streams service. API key values must be supplied on every REST request
      using the `X-Auth-Token` HTTP header. Failure to specify a valid API key
      will result in the REST request failing with a 401 (Unauthorized) status
      code. `X-Auth-Token` header is deprecated, `Authorization` header is recommanded.
  TokenAuth:
    type: apiKey
    in: header
    name: Authorization
    description: >
      A valid token or API key is required to access this API. API keys can be allocated
      via the IBM Cloud interface, and are associated with an instance of the
      Event Streams service. Token is obtained upon login to IBM Cloud and is associated with 
      the identity of the user. Either token or API key must be supplied on every REST request
      using the `Authorization` `Bearer ${TokenOrAPIKey}` HTTP header. Failure to do so will 
      result in the REST request failing with a 401 (Unauthorized) status code.
  BasicAuth:
    type: basic
    description: >
      To use basic authentication, the HTTP header name is `Authorization`, value is 
      `Basic <base64 encoded value of username:password>.
      For enterprise plan, user name is `token`, password is API key. For standard plan, user
      name is tenant ID, password is API key.

    in: query
    required: false
    type: string
    description: >
        A filter to be applied to the topic names. A simple filter can be specified as
        a string with asterisk (`*`) wildcards representing 0 or more characters, e.g.
        `topic-name*` will filter all topic names that begin with the string `topic-name`
        followed by any character sequence. A more complex filter pattern can be used
        by surrounding a regular expression in forward slash (`/`) delimiters, e.g.
        `/topic-name.* /`.
