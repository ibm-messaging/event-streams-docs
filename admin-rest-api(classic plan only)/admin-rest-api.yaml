      A valid API key is required to access this API.  API keys can be allocated
      via the IBM Bluemix interface, and are associated with an instance of the
      Event Streams service. API key values must be supplied on every REST request
      using the `X-Auth-Token` HTTP header. Failure to specify a valid API key
      will result in the REST request failing with a 401 (Unauthorized) status
      code.
